# spring-5-reactive
Example of Spring 5 Webflux and Webclient.
This is a quick and practical example of the Spring Webflux support on the server side, and a simple Reactive Webclient on the client side.
The endpoint will produce one event per second infinitely and the client side will simply consume and log the events as they arrive.
